The sales process took two years and took everything out of me. I cried under my desk at work several times. I experienced many editors saying yes and many higher-ups saying no because my book challenged the market. In the end, my book sold 20,000 copies, which is a lot for a book, but I still didn't earn out my advance. I had four months to write the book (crash schedule. The book promotion process was very intense and I felt I had no right to say no to many requests. It took two years to recover my health afterward after intense insomnia (sometimes 7 nights with no sleep). Of course we have to factor in taxes and agent fees and realize too that authors do not get to keep the lump sums listed here. In my opinion, writing books is not a way to earn a living - at least not for me - because I am too slow a writer. I learned I had to start a business to support myself that would give me time to continue to write books, since that is my deepest calling."

Forget editors, it was hard to explain the book to agents too. I was writing about Abu Dhabi, in American, psuedo-British, and Arab and Malayalee [ala Indian-ish] vernacular. Exhausted, I started saying, ""It's like Rushdie's Midnight's Children,"" which it wasn't, and it isn't, but that's what we (once I finally nabbed my agent) went with."" ","I was published by an independent press, Restless Books, which wanted to get diverse voices out there, and I'm grateful they exist. But it helped I won their inaugural Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing, which came with a $10,000 prize money and a book deal. Until I won the prize, it had been hard for my agent to sell the book. We came close, but then not so much when everyone realized I didn't have a second book in the works (at the time anyway), preferably a novel. 

It took me ten years to finish Temporary People, the book I wrote. I work slow and it's possible I am probably a two, maybe-three, if I'm really lucky, a four-book guy. No more. But this expectation to produce, and work (I teach) on the side, is exhausting. And I'm still feeling this way after the book won two additional prizes, on different continents, and was long-listed and/or shortlisted here and there. Sometimes I wonder, Perhaps the publishers (or Restless, who published me) won't wait for the next one? There are no guarantees, and I've made my peace with that. "
